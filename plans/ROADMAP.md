# ROADMAP: The Kubestronaut Textbook

A hands-on textbook covering everything needed for the five certifications that make up **Kubestronaut**: **KCNA, KCSA, CKAD, CKA, CKS**.

- **Audience:** readers who already know Linux, basic web development, and containers.
- **Format:** one Markdown file per chapter, plus setup files for each chapter's lab environment.
- **Labs:** KodeKloud/Killercoda-style, repeatable and resettable with one command, self-checking.
- **Assessment:** end-of-chapter questions in every chapter, plus a mock exam per certification.

> **Before locking the outline:** verify each certification's current curriculum (domains, weights, Kubernetes version) on the CNCF/Linux Foundation curriculum repos. Update `docs/coverage-matrix.md` (see §6) whenever they change.

---

## 1. Guiding principles

1. **Teach by topic, tag by exam.** The five exams overlap heavily. Chapters are organized by subject; each chapter declares which exams it serves.
2. **Every lab is disposable.** A reader can break anything and be back at the starting state in under a minute.
3. **Every lab is verifiable.** Each task has an automated check, so readers get instant PASS/FAIL feedback.
4. **Every lab is tested in CI.** If the reference solution does not pass `verify.sh` in CI, the chapter does not merge.
5. **Speed matters.** The performance-based exams are timed. Labs teach imperative `kubectl`, docs navigation, and time budgeting from Part I onward, not just in the exam-prep part.
6. **One version pin.** The Kubernetes version and all tool versions live in a single `versions.env`.

## 3. Lab infrastructure

| Tier | Environment | Used for | Reset method |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | kind / k3d (multi-node) on the reader's machine | ~70% of chapters: workloads, config, services, storage, RBAC, scheduling | Delete namespace, or delete and recreate the cluster |
| 2 | Multi-VM kubeadm cluster (Vagrant, Lima, or Multipass) | Cluster install, upgrades, etcd backup/restore, node troubleshooting, most of CKS (AppArmor, seccomp, Falco, kernel-level work) | Restore VM snapshot |
| 3 | Devcontainer / Codespaces / Killercoda scenarios | Readers without capable hardware | Rebuild container / restart scenario |

**Reset contract** (identical in every chapter):

| Script | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `setup.sh` | Idempotent. Creates the exact starting state. Safe to run repeatedly. |
| `reset.sh` | Tears down chapter resources and re-runs `setup.sh`. |
| `verify.sh` | Runs one check per task; prints `PASS`/`FAIL` with a hint; exits non-zero on any failure. |
| `solutions.md` | Step-by-step solutions, one per task, in a separate file. |

Each lab runs in its own namespace (Tier 1) or snapshot (Tier 2) so that chapters never interfere with each other.

**Hardware requirements to state in Chapter 3:** Tier 1 needs roughly 4 GB RAM free; Tier 2 needs roughly 8 to 16 GB. Point everyone else to Tier 3.

---

## 4. Chapter template

Every chapter follows this structure:

1. **Header block:** exams served (tags), difficulty, estimated time, lab tier, prerequisites
2. **Learning objectives** (mapped to curriculum bullets)
3. **Concepts:** explanation with Mermaid diagrams
4. **Guided walkthrough:** commands with expected output
5. **Hands-on lab:** 3 to 6 tasks, each with a suggested time limit and difficulty label
6. **Exam tips:** imperative shortcuts, which docs pages to bookmark
7. **End-of-chapter questions:** 10 to 15 (multiple choice for KCNA/KCSA style; performance tasks for CKA/CKAD/CKS style)
8. **Further reading**

### Chapter definition of done

- [ ] Text reviewed against the current curriculum bullets it claims to cover
- [ ] All commands executed on the pinned Kubernetes version
- [ ] `setup.sh`, `reset.sh`, `verify.sh` implemented and idempotent
- [ ] CI run: setup, apply reference solution, `verify.sh` passes
- [ ] CI run: `verify.sh` fails on the untouched starting state (proves the checks are real)
- [ ] `reset.sh` verified after a deliberately broken lab
- [ ] Questions written, each with an explanation of the correct answer
- [ ] Coverage matrix updated
- [ ] Read by one person at the target level who was not the author

## 6. Coverage matrix

Maintain `docs/coverage-matrix.md` as a table with one row per curriculum bullet:

| Exam | Domain | Bullet (verbatim from curriculum) | Chapter | Lab task | Question IDs | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

This is the proof of "covers all materials." Review it at the end of every phase and before every release.

---

## 7. Phases and milestones

Estimates assume one author working part-time; adjust for your pace and any co-authors.

### Phase 0: Foundations (2 to 3 weeks)
- [ ] Style guide, chapter template, lab-authoring guide
- [ ] Repo skeleton, `versions.env`, Makefile targets (`lab`, `reset`, `verify`, `solve`)
- [ ] Shared shell library (`tools/lib.sh`) with assertion and wait helpers
- [ ] CI pipeline: markdown lint, shellcheck, yamllint, kind-based lab runner
- [ ] Question-bank format and renderer
- [ ] Coverage matrix populated from all five current curricula (empty status)
- [ ] **Pilot chapter (Ch. 04) finished to the full definition of done**
- **Exit criterion:** a stranger can clone the repo, run `make lab CH=04`, complete the lab, break it, and `make reset CH=04`.

### Phase 1: Parts I and II (~8 weeks)
- [ ] Chapters 01 to 16 drafted, tested, reviewed
- [ ] Tier 3 devcontainer working
- **Exit criterion:** all Tier 1 labs pass the CI loop; coverage matrix shows KCNA and CKAD material complete.

### Phase 2: Part III (~8 weeks)
- [ ] Tier 2 environment built first: Vagrant/Lima/Multipass config, base-image build, snapshot-based reset
- [ ] Chapters 17 to 28
- **Exit criterion:** a full kubeadm cluster can be rebuilt from scratch, upgraded, and restored from an etcd backup by following the book alone.

### Phase 3: Part IV (~8 weeks)
- [ ] Chapters 29 to 36; pin and test Trivy, Falco, kube-bench, Kyverno/Gatekeeper versions
- **Exit criterion:** every CKS and KCSA bullet in the coverage matrix is mapped and tested.

### Phase 4: Part V and mock exams (~4 weeks)
- [ ] Chapters 37 to 39
- [ ] Five mock exams; time-test each yourself and record how long it took
- **Exit criterion:** mock exams reflect exam format and difficulty, and a beta reader finishes a mock within the allotted time on a first attempt only after studying the book.

### Phase 5: Beta and release (4+ weeks)
- [ ] Recruit 3 to 5 beta readers at the target level
- [ ] Collect stuck-points per chapter; fix environment bugs first, prose second
- [ ] Full re-verification against current curricula and Kubernetes version
- [ ] Release v1.0; publish errata process

**Total:** roughly 8 to 10 months part-time. Labs and environments take more effort than the prose.

## 8. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Curriculum or Kubernetes version changes mid-project | Single `versions.env`; coverage matrix; CI re-runs all labs on a version bump |
| Lab scripts rot over time | Every lab in CI; scheduled weekly CI run against pinned and latest versions |
| Tier 2 hardware requirements exclude readers | Tier 3 hosted option; document minimum specs clearly |
| Labs work on the author's machine only | Beta readers on Linux, macOS, and Windows (WSL2); CI on Linux |
| Security tooling (Falco, Trivy) changes quickly | Pin versions; isolate tool setup in per-chapter `setup.sh` |
| Scope creep (topics beyond the exams) | Every section must map to a coverage-matrix row, or go in "Further reading" |
| Copying exam content | Write original questions and scenarios from the public curricula only; never reproduce real exam questions |

---

## 9. Immediate next steps

1. Decide the Tier 2 tool (Vagrant, Lima, or Multipass) based on the platforms you want to support.
2. Write `docs/chapter-template.md` and `docs/lab-authoring.md`.
3. Build the Makefile and `tools/lib.sh`.
4. Write the pilot chapter (04: Pods) end to end.
5. Set up CI and make the pilot chapter pass the setup, solve, verify loop.
